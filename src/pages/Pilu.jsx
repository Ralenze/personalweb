          OMG Hii. I love you so so much. How do I even express my love??

            but real love isn't (always) loud. It's in the quiet moments, the shared smiles, the comfort of just being together. I love you more than words can say, more than any grand gesture could show. I love you when you wrap yourself up in a little blankie, or when you dress up in cute tops and look oh so so adorable.

            and I love you always and I genuinely wish it is us always. 
            When you complain about your hair being a mess, it looks perfect and 
            stylish to me. When you worry about your hands being wet and sweaty, 
            I just want to hold them and feel the warmth, like a hot damp towel surrounding my hands. 
            When you feel insecure about being tall or your body, I just want to hold you tight and tell 
            you that you look absolutely perfect to me. And when you feel that you are too worring, 
            too stressed, I want to be there for you and ease your pain. I will always be yours, and I am always
            for you through the good, but also the bad.

          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            oh I adore everything about you. the little birthmark next to your eye. your white nails. 
            your cute laugh, as cute as a hyena-seagull hybrid can be. your smile when you tilt your head
             and look at me with those squinted eyes. 
          </p>

            and all those plans we made, we will tick them off one by one. parties in LA. vacations to paris. 
            snowboarding at kananaski. camp trips at yellowstone, hiking through yosemite. cruise trips around the 
            caribbean. late nights on cobblestone roads in europe. dogsledding in yukon. we will go everywhere and do
            everything together and try everything, i promise you that much.

            Let this valentines and anniversary be a reminder of how far we've both come, and how far we
             are both willing to work for each other. We will always communicate with each other when 
             something is troubling us, no matter how painful. Those pillars of relationship that we agreed
             on, effort, communication, honesty, loyalty, comfort, is why we have and will always make it 
             through long distance, through hardships, through everything. Our signs are perfectly aligned.
             You are the 2 to my 4, the Aries to my Gemini, the 18 to my 9 that make us 27. I could not have
             spent these 7 months with another person, and I will not spend my future months with anyone else but you.
             You are my future.

            I don't know if youre checking this today, or in another day. But I just wanted to really tell you that I love you so much. I wish I could send those reels, say those words to you right now. I know I can't, and neither can you. But when you feel down, 
            or sad, please remember that I truly am grateful for you, 
            and I will always be there for you if you let me. 
            I chose you and I'm not choosing anyone else.
             Pilu, I love you.

            I don't know if you will see this. Real love isn't always loud, and similarly, I'm not going to text you
            that I updated this page. Think of it as a journal, I guess. Each day this week I'll quietly write down words that I'm aching to 
            text you. Each moment I can't talk to you I miss you dearly. That's all I wanted to say, and I 
            hope you feel this way about me too.
