## Purpose

After debating for some time, I've decided to build up a blog that documents my journey as a software engineer and exciting events that shape my life. Occasionally, I'm thinking of posting opinions that I have on different topics.

Basically, this is where I write down ideas and stuff that's worth sharing, but not through LinkedIn or IG or anything like that. It might also just be a monthly update on what I'm working on, fun places I've been to, and anything else. I don't think I'll be updating this frequently however.

Finally, I'll just highlight tech stacks that I work with: React, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Tailwind, Django, TensorFlow, PyTorch, C++, Kotlin, Playwright, Electron. I'm always willing to learn more, but this represents a little bit of what I can use today.
